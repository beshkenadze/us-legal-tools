Department of Labor (DOL) Open Data API
The DOL API is a web service that provides on-demand access to machine readable metadata and data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

*Important Notice:** This is the v4 API, part of the 2025 API migration from v1/v2. All users must migrate to this version.

*Benefits:**
- Customizable response - request subsets of data instead of entire datasets
- Automation - reuse customized data requests for productive workflows  
- Live and updated data - always returns the latest data with documented update frequencies
- Programming-language agnostic - works with Python, R, SAS, and more
- Read-only access - all operations are safe, idempotent queries

*Getting Started:**
1. Register for an account at https://dataportal.dol.gov/registration (registration is required)
2. Complete the questionnaire to get an API key
3. Use your API key as a query parameter (X-API-KEY=your_key) for all data requests

*Rate Limits:**
- Up to 5 MB of data or 10,000 records per request (whichever limit is hit first)
- Up to 5 API keys per account
- Rate limit information may be returned in response headers (when implemented):
 - X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests allowed
 - X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests remaining in current window
 - X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
 - Note: Rate limit headers are not implemented on all endpoints

*Data Freshness:**
- Dataset update frequencies vary by source
- Check the 'last_updated' field in metadata responses
- Most datasets are updated daily, weekly, or monthly

*Finding Agency and Endpoint Combinations:**
- Use the `/datasets` endpoint to discover all available datasets (note: this endpoint is paginated)
- Each dataset includes an `agency` object with abbreviation and an `api_url` field
- Common agencies include: 'msha' (Mine Safety and Health Administration), 'ilab' (Bureau of International Labor Affairs),
 'wb' (Women's Bureau), 'osha' (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), 'ebsa' (Employee Benefits Security Administration)
- Example dataset endpoints: msha/accident, ilab/better_trade_tool_core_data, wb/ndcp
- To access all datasets, iterate through pages using the `page` query parameter
- Note: Some agencies like BLS may not have datasets in the current catalog

OpenAPI spec version: 4.0.0
